- A fundamental problem is not fraud or QRPs, but sloppiness and uncritical evaluation

## Statcheck
- Statcheck can help you identify reporting errors. It's like spellcheck for stats.
- Reads APA formatted statistics (60% of the time)
- High but imperfect accuracy of identifying reporting errors
- Available as an R package and online. 

## GRIM
GRIM is a method for identifying errors in the reporting of means. Where n<100, means rounded to 2 decimal places can only have certain terminal values. 
Need to be mindful of exclusions which can change the effective N. 

Accessible via [web app](nickbrown.fr/GRIM)

## SPRITE

Doesn't find mathematical errors, but can offer possible distributions which may or may not be plausible given the constructs being assesesed.

Should be combined with other information to assess problems.
 - Range (what range of observed scores are provided)
 - Mentions (are components of the data otherwise described e.g. "x% responded in the affirmative")
 - Grains (other inputs e.g. subscale)
 
Allows interrogation of data plausibility, or appropriateness of analysis (i.e. did the data meet the distributional assumptions).
